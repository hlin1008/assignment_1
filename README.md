# Assignment 1 - Geolocation Distance Minimization

## Mission
If the user gives you two arrays of geolocation, match each point in the first array to the closest one in the second array.

## Solution
Create a function that inputs two arrays(of tuples) and outputs an array of tuples indicating the closest point.
In the function, iterate through tuples in both arrays and apply the Euclidean distance function to find the shortest distance.
Update values accordingly.
